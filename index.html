            <h2>About Me!üëãüèª</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Malikus Syafaadi Nurfaza, and I'm a third-year Computer
              Science student at IPB University. I'm passionate about software
              engineering, specifically front-end development, and have
              experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React). Outside of the
              classroom, I enjoy gaming and exploring new cafes. I'm a quick
              learner, always eager to expand my knowledge, and I'm excited to
              join a dynamic team where I can contribute my skills.

            <h3>HIMALKOM</h3>
            <p>
              As a member of HIMALKOM (Himpunan Mahasiswa Ilmu Komputer) in
              2023, I was actively involved in various activities and made
              significant contributions to the organization. I served as a staff
              member in the Human Research and Development division and as the
              head of the Ilkomers Sport and Art Competition. In my role as HRD
              staff, I assisted in the recruitment and development process of
              new HIMALKOM members. As the head of the Ilkomers Sport and Art
              Competition, I was responsible for the overall planning and
              execution of the event, which successfully attracted a large
              participation from students.

            <h3>IT TODAY</h3>
            <p>
              In IT TODAY 2023, I had the opportunity to be a part of the Public
              Relations team. My role as a committee member included acting as a
              liaison between the internal and external parties of the event. I
              was also responsible for disseminating information and promoting
              the IT TODAY 2023 event to the wider public through various media
              partners. My contributions to the Public Relations team helped to
              increase public awareness and participation in the IT TODAY 2023
              event.

            <h3>CPSC</h3>
            <p>
              At the National Science Festival (PSN) 2023, I led the Public
              Relations Division of the CPSC (Computer Problem Solving
              Competition). I was responsible for establishing partnerships with
              schools and media partners to disseminate information and attract
              interest from high school students across Indonesia to participate
              in the CPSC.
